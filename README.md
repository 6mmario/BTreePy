# BTree - B-tree implementation in Python for didactic purposes.

## Overview
This B-tree implementation includes algorithms to add, search 
and delete values from a B-tree. It was inspired by this 
Wikipedia article: 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btree

Searching within nodes is done using binary search (using the 
bisect module).
